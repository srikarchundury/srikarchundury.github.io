I'm Srikar Chundury, a graduate student diving deep into the world of Computer Science at NC State. I'm all about pushing the boundaries of performance computing, tinkering with distributed systems, and optimizing programs to run like lightning. In my previous gig at Walmart Labs, I had a blast building cloud-native applications from start to finish. Right now, I'm geeking out as a Graduate Research Assistant at North Carolina State University, where I'm laser-focused on squeezing every ounce of efficiency out of tensor network contractions. Oh, and I'm also delving into the mind-bending realm of high performance quantum simulations as part of the Quantum Natural Language Processing project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Check out my projects, where I dabble in Big Data, Cloud Computing, Performance Profiling, and Machine Learning.
